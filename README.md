# My dotfiles

I used [this]( http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/ ) link to help me manage my dotfiles in an organized manner
### Some TODOs, other than just cloning the repo:
YouCompleteMe needs to be compiled: see https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe,
or just do (with cmake installed):
`cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.sh --clang-completer`

Silver searcher needs to be installed
